=is_gd library

# is_gd is a library to minify URLs using "http://is.gd":http://is.gd service, so you'll (obviously) need a network connection.
# More info here on the API itself: "http://is.gd/api_info.php":http://is.gd/api_info.php

This is such a simple library, it doesn't need much explanation at all. There are two modes:
#You give it a URL, and it will give you back a URL minified with "http://is.gd":http://is.gd
  IsGd.minify('www.google.com') (returns: 'http://is.gd/2')
#You give it an is.gd minified URL and it will tell you the source URL.
  IsGd.un_minify('http://is.gd/2') (returns: 'http://www.google.com')
