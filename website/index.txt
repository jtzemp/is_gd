h2. What is the "is_gd ruby library":http://geekjacking.com/is_gd?

# is_gd is a library to minify URLs using "http://is.gd":http://is.gd service.
# More info here on the API itself: "http://is.gd/api_info.php":http://is.gd/api_info.php

This is such a simple library, it doesn't need much explanation at all. There are two modes:
# You give it a URL, and it will give you back a URL minified with is.gd
  IsGd.minify('www.google.com') (returns: 'http://is.gd/2')
# You give it an is.gd minified URL and it will tell you the source URL.
  IsGd.un_minify('http://is.gd/2') (returns: 'http://www.google.com')

h2. How to submit patches

Read the "8 steps for fixing other people's code":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/06/01/8-steps-for-fixing-other-peoples-code/. It's good, but doesn't have instructions for GitHub, so come back here after you're done and read on.

If you want to submit patches (or check out the code to see how to change from base 10 to base 62) the project code is on GitHub. Here are good instructions for submitting patches through GitHub: "http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications":http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications
